# DFU Library

[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/nordic/android/dfu-library/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/nordic/android/dfu-library/_latestVersion)

### Usage

The compat library may be found on jcenter and Maven Central repository. Add it to your project by adding the following dependency:

```Groovy
compile 'no.nordicsemi.android:dfu:1.3.0'
```

If you use proguard, add the following line to your proguard rules:
```-keep class no.nordicsemi.android.dfu.** { *; }```

### Device Firmware Update (DFU)

The nRF5x Series chips are flash-based SoCs, and as such they represent the most flexible solution available. A key feature of the nRF5x Series and their associated software architecture
and S-Series SoftDevices is the possibility for Over-The-Air Device Firmware Upgrade (OTA-DFU). See Figure 1. OTA-DFU allows firmware upgrades to be issued and downloaded to products 
in the field via the cloud and so enables OEMs to fix bugs and introduce new features to products that are already out on the market. 
This brings added security and flexibility to product development when using the nRF5x Series SoCs.

![Device Firmware Update](resources/dfu.png)

This repository contains a tested library for Android 4.3+ platform which may be used to perform Device Firmware Update on the nRF5x device using a phone or a tablet.

DFU library has been designed to make it very easy to include these devices into your application. It is compatible with all Bootloader/DFU versions.

### Documentation

See the [documentation](documentation) for more information.

### Requirements

The library is compatible with nRF51 and nRF52 devices with S-Series Soft Device and the DFU Bootloader flashed on. 

### DFU History

#### Legacy DFU

* **SDK 4.3.0** - First version of DFU over Bluetooth Smart. DFU supports Application update.
* **SDK 6.1.0** - DFU Bootloader supports Soft Device and Bootloader update. As the updated Bootloader may be dependent on the new Soft Device, those two may be sent and installed together.
    - Buttonless update support for non-bonded devices.
* **SDK 7.0.0** - The extended init packet is required. The init packet contains additional validation information: device type and revision, application version, compatible Soft Devices and the firmware CRC.
* **SDK 8.0.0** - The bond information may be preserved after an application update. The new application, when first started, will send the Service Change indication to the phone to refresh the services.
    - Buttonless update support for bonded devices 
    - sharing the LTK between an app and the bootloader.
    
#### Secure DFU

* **SDK 12.0.0** - New Secure DFU has been released. Buttonless service is experimental.
* **SDK 13.0.0** - Buttonless DFU (still experimental) uses different UUIDs. No bond sharing supported. Bootloader will use address +1.

This library is fully backwards compatible and supports both the new and legacy DFU.
The experimental buttonless DFU service from SDK 12 is supported since version 1.1.0. Due to the fact, that this experimental service is not safe,
you have to call [starter.setUnsafeExperimentalButtonlessServiceInSecureDfuEnabled(true)](https://github.com/NordicSemiconductor/Android-DFU-Library/blob/release/dfu/src/main/java/no/nordicsemi/android/dfu/DfuServiceInitiator.java#L194)
to enable it. Read the method documentation for details. It is recommended to use the Buttonless service from SDK 13 (for non-bonded devices, or 14 (when released) for bonded).
Both are supported since DFU Library 1.3.0.

Check platform folders for mode details about compatibility for each library.
